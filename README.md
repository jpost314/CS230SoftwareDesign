Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room wanted a solution to manage and develop a gaming application based on the Win, Lose or Draw from the 1980s. They needed an app that would allow customers to register accounts, create teams, process payments, and manage game inventory. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I offered solid recommendations for the type of architecture, OS, and deployment model necessary to reach a wide base and offer a usable application that met our customer's requirements. While there is no perfect solution, I provided ample justification for my recommendations and why they would serve the Gaming Room well. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- The design documents served as an outline and roadmap for the development process. The UML diagrams were particularly helpful as a visual representation of the class structure needed for this project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If I could spend more time on one part, I would have liked to explore the other OS that I am less familiar with a bit more. It was difficult to imagine recommending an OS that I have virtually zero experience using. If I could do this project again, I would pick a different OS, and dig into the pros and cons of using a different setup. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The user's needs were laid out clearly in our project documents. I made a list of the client's required criteria for the project and used it as a master checklist to ensure that the client's vision was being fulfilled. Keeping the user's needs in mind is vital for creating an intuitive UI, and ensuring that people want to continue engaging with your application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I worked from left-to-right from the client's checklist of criteria, to developing code, and finally to testing and receiving feedback. In the future, I will continue using some form of a criteria checklist and class diagrams before I begin the coding process. It helps break up the coding process into smaller cycles.
